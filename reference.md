## Module Specs

### RAGPipeline

State shape: `docs[]`, `query`, `config { topK, chunkSize, overlap }`, `result { answer, retrievedDocs[] } | { error }`

Retrieval (`src/lib/retrieval.js`): documents are split into overlapping chunks (`chunkSize`/`overlap`),
each chunk and the query are embedded as term-frequency bag-of-words vectors, and ranking is by cosine
similarity; top `topK` chunks are returned. This is a real (local, dependency-free) vector-similarity
approximation — not keyword matching.

Claude system prompt pattern:

> "Answer using ONLY the provided context. Cite documents used. Format with **Answer**, **Sources Used**, **Confidence Level**."

Extend by: swapping the local TF-cosine scorer for real embeddings + a vector DB (Pinecone, pgvector,
Weaviate). The embedding-model and vector-store dropdowns are bound to state and shown in the caption,
ready to drive a real backend.

---

### AgentOrchestration

State: `task`, `tools[] { id, name, enabled, desc }`, `steps[]`, `finalAnswer`

Step types: `thought` (indigo), `tool_use` (blue), `observation` (green), `answer` (amber).

Steps animate in with 600ms stagger. Claude returns JSON: `{ steps: [...], answer: "..." }`.

Extend by: real tool dispatch, LangChain/Semantic Kernel adapter layer, SSE streaming for live token output.

---

### PromptStudio

State: `prompt`, `analysis { score, clarity, security, efficiency, strengths[], issues[], optimized_prompt }`, `guardrails[]`

Claude returns scored JSON. Guardrails (PII Filter ON, Toxicity Guard ON, Hallucination Check OFF, Cost Guard ON) are UI toggles — not wired to actual middleware yet.

Extend by: real pre/post processing middleware, A/B comparison mode, AWS Bedrock Guardrails integration.

---

### ArchitecturePatterns

Three SVG diagrams (no Claude API calls — static):

- `rag` — API Gateway → RAG Service → Embeddings → Vector DB → Claude API + Cache + Monitoring
- `agent` — Orchestrator → Planner / Executor / Critic → Tools / Memory → Claude API
- `secure` — Client → WAF → Auth/IAM + PII Filter → Claude API + Audit Log + DLP/SIEM

Nodes: `{ id, x, y, w, h, label, color, text }`. Edges: quadratic Bézier with SVG marker arrowheads.

Extend by: drag-to-reposition nodes, PNG/SVG export, AWS/GCP service icons.

---

### Monitoring

All data is mock (static arrays). Charts: Recharts `BarChart` (daily token input/output), `AreaChart` (hourly p50/p95/p99 latency with gradient fills), model breakdown cards.

Extend by: Anthropic Usage API, Datadog/CloudWatch, LangSmith/Langfuse trace IDs, per-tenant cost allocation.
